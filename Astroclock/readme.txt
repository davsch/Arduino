The project is about creating a Arduino-driven timer for multiple purposes controlled by dusk/dawn and it´s timeshift depending on the latitude and date.
The intention is to use 433.92 MHz transmitter to communicate with each of the appliences to be controlled - for eg external house light, garden decorations.
